# Machine Learning Quiz

## How do you know when you are ready?
* I have interviewed about 40 people with DS/ML background and I estimated only 1 or 2 of them actually get a shot at FAANG. It's very competitive. 
* I have prepared ML tests based on real questions at big companies i.e: FAAG, Linkedin, Snapchat etc... If you can score in top 5% (9 out of 10) and you are good at System design/Machine Learning system design then you're probably ready for interview. 

## Machine Learning readiness

If you can score 9/10 corrected questions, you are quite ready for ML interview. Send an email to helppreparemle@gmail.com for solution. 
* [ML quiz 12 (medium level)](https://forms.gle/aieiHULBTHRYpNH59)
* [ML quiz 531 (a bit difficult)](https://forms.gle/dLK8TE6NLoWNU1LV6)

This chart shows the score distribution for ML quiz 12. You should try to get 9/10 corrected questions to get to the top 5%.

## Leetcode readiness
* You can to solve Medium question within 20 minutes with little to no bug and clean code. 
* You can solve medium question with 2,3 different solutions (recursive, top-down DP with memorization, bottom-up DP, bfs/dfs). 
* You can estimate time complexity for your algorithm correctly. 


## ML system design readiness (TBD)
* See [design](design.md)
