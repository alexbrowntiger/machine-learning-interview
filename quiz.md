# Machine Learning Quiz

* If you can score 9/10 corrected questions, you are quite ready for ML interview. I have prepared ML tests based on real questions at big companies i.e: FAAG, Linkedin, Snapchat etc... 
* If you can score in top 5% (9 out of 10) and you are good at System design/Machine Learning system design then you're probably ready for interview. Send an email to helppreparemle@gmail.com for solution. 

* List of quizzes
| Quiz | Release date | Number of people took quiz | Top 5% score |

## Leetcode readiness
* You can to solve Medium question within 20 minutes with little to no bug and clean code. 
* You can solve medium question with 2,3 different solutions (recursive, top-down DP with memorization, bottom-up DP, bfs/dfs). 
* You can estimate time complexity for your algorithm correctly. 


## ML system design readiness (TBD)
* See [design](design.md)
