* I use [LC time tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RCb1dVQCLmtOGlJ5J-NJ5pIC7Tda-N2U/edit#gid=274831950) to keep track of how many times I solves a question and how long I spent each time. Once I finish non-trivial medium LC questions 3 times, I have absolutely no issues solving them in actual interviews (sometimes within 8-10 minutes). It makes a big difference.

* This [Leetcode post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665604/important-and-useful-links-from-all-over-the-leetcode/659097) combines 36 tips and tricks in improving Leetcode problem solving skills.

## LinkedList
* Contrary to popular belief, no body really asked LinkedList questions during the interview. There is one exception where you need to use LinkedList to implement [LRU](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/). [Copy list with random pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

## Design
* [LRU cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/solution/)
