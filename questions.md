# Yet another questions list

* Why do we need the 8209th questions list on github? The questions here sorted by different area and focus on testing your actual knowledge instead of checking your memorization. 
* How do you pick questions? A good question can distinguish candidate that **understand** ve candidates that **knows** the concept. There are two level of questions: fundamental and advance, depend on your timeline you might want to priortize your learning accordingly. 



| Question | Level |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Underlying decision tree algorithm, what's the difference between regression and classification? | Fundamental |
| What is the difference between logistic regression vs multilayer perceptron? | Advance |
| [Why L1 sparse?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/45643/why-l1-norm-for-sparse-models) | Advance |
| Why do RNNs have a tendency to suffer from exploding/vanishing gradient?  | Fundamental |
| What is the problem with sigmoid during backprop?  | Advance |
| What is the problem with Relu? Why do we need Leaky Relu?  | Fundamental |
| What are the assumptions of linear/logistic regression?  | Fundamental |
| If some features have strong colinearity does it make model performance worse?  | Fundamental |
| What does the decision boundary of logistic regression look like?  | Fundamental |
