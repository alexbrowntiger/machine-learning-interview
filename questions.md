# Yet another questions list

* Why do we need the 8209th questions list on github? The questions here sorted by different area and focus on testing your actual knowledge instead of checking your memorization. 
* How do you pick questions? A good question can distinguish candidate that **understand** ve candidates that **knows** the concept. There are two level of questions: fundamental and advance, depend on your timeline you might want to priortize your learning accordingly.
