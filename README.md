# Machine Learning Interview Preparation (MLIP)
## Why?
* Preparing for Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) position is very challenging 1) many technical areas to cover 2) wide range of skills set: ML, coding and system design and 3) there are no shortage of material on the internet but they failed short in either not breath enough or not deep enough. 
* One solution is to provide a minimum set of areas that actually reflect interview questions. You can see [study guide](plan.md). 


## How to prepare for interview? 
1. Before you prepare for interiview, you can read [common questions](start.md). 
2. For preparation: use the [study guide](plan.md) as a collections of focused areas. 
3. During/after preparation: use [readyness tests](ready.md) to see if you're  ready for interview. 
4. Prepare for ML system design: use [ML usecase](design.md) to go practice actual ML system design usecases.
