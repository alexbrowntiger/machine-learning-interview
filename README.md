# Machine Learning Interview Preparation (MLIP)
## Why?
* Preparing for Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) position is very challenging 1) many technical areas to cover 2) wide range of skills set: ML, coding and system design and 3) there are no shortage of material on the internet but they failed short in either not breath enough or not deep enough. 
* One solution is to provide a minimum set of areas that actually reflect interview questions. You can see [study guide](plan.md). I wrote this guide based real interview experiences at close to 20 companies i.e FAAG, Snapchat, Linkedin, StitchFix, Intuit, Glassdoor.
